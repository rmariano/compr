PyCompress
==========

``Pycompressor`` is a tool for compressing text files into smaller ones, as
well as extracting compressed files back into the original content.

It can be used as a program or imported as a package module,
and use the functions defined on it.


For example, in order to compress one file:

.. code:: bash

    $ pycompress -c /usr/share/dict/words -d /tmp/compressed.zf

The original file, in this example has a size of ``~4.8M``, and the tool left
the resulting file at ``/tmp/compressed.zf``, with a size of ``~2.7M``.

In order to extract it:

.. code:: bash

    $ pycompress -x /tmp/compressed.zf -d /tmp/original

You can specify the name of the resulting file with the ``-d`` flag. If you
don't indicate a name for the resulting file, the default will be
``<original-file>.comp``.

For the full options, run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pycompress -h


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

   pip install trenzalore


Will install the package and leave an application named ``pycompress`` for
using the command line utility.


Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the package in development mode, run::

    make dev

And run the tests with::

    make test

Tests have dependencies that can be installed by running ``make testdeps``.

Before submitting a pull request, run the checklist to make sure all
dependencies are met (code style/linting, tests, pass, etc.). This is automated
with:

.. code:: bash

    make checklist

This will run the checks for the code style (``make lint``), as well as the
tests (``make test``).

In order to check that the project runs with the supported Python versions,
run:

.. code:: bash

    make tox
