PyCompressor
============

``Pycompressor`` is a tool for compressing text files into smaller ones, as
well as extracting compressed files back into the original content.

For example, in order to compress one file:

.. code:: bash

    $ pycompress -c -d /tmp/compressed.zf /usr/share/dict/words

The original file, in this example has a size of ``~4.8M``, and the tool left
the resulting file at ``/tmp/compressed.zf``, with a size of ``~2.7M``.

In order to extract it:

.. code:: bash

    $ pycompress -x -d /tmp/original /tmp/compressed.zf

You can specify the name of the resulting file with the ``-d`` flag. If you
don't indicate a name for the resulting file, the default will be
``<original-file>.comp``.

For the full options, run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pycompress -h
